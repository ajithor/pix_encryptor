# pix_encryptor
Python code to encrypt(simply XORs with a private key) images .

This program first XORs an image(preferably) with a user-defined private kay and XORs over it with another user defined Public key.
The code can be modified to keep the public key as an 'Arbitrary Constant' value for a given Network.
This is created as a solution to not using OpenCV.

OpenCV itself has some dependencies.
OpenCV doesn't work(official versions) with newer Python Versions(as of now)\
Demonstrate imageio and visvis as alternates for OpenCV.
